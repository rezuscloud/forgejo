## Docker compose with docker-in-docker

> **Warning** this example is just what it is: an example. It is not fit to be used in production. It shows how Forgejo, the Forgejo runner can work together with Docker in Docker. It is [tested to work in the CI](../../.forgejo/workflows/example-docker-compose.yml) and is best used as a reference, a source of inspiration.

The `compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml` compose file runs a Forgejo
instance and registers a `Forgejo runner`. A docker server is also
launched within a container (using
[dind](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker/tags?name=dind)) and will be
used by the `Forgejo runner` to execute the workflows.

### Quick start

```sh
rm -fr /srv/runner-data /srv/forgejo-data
secret=$(openssl rand -hex 20)
sed -i -e "s/{SHARED_SECRET}/$secret/" compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml
docker compose -f compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml up -d
```

Visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/admin/actions/runners with login `root` and password `{ROOT_PASSWORD}` and see the runner is registered with the label `docker`.

> NOTE: the `Your ROOT_URL in app.ini is "http://localhost:3000/", it's unlikely matching the site you are visiting.` message is a warning that can be ignored in the context of this example.

```sh
docker compose -f compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml -f compose-demo-workflow.yml up demo-workflow
```

Visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/root/test/actions/runs/1 and see that the job ran.


### Running

Create a shared secret with:

```sh
openssl rand -hex 20
```

Replace all occurrences of {SHARED_SECRET} in
[compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml](compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml).

> **NOTE:** a token obtained from the Forgejo web interface cannot be used as a shared secret.

Replace {ROOT_PASSWORD} with a secure password in
[compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml](compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml).

```sh
docker compose -f compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml up

### Manual testing

To login the Forgejo instance:

* URL: http://0.0.0.0:8080
* user: `root`
* password: `{ROOT_PASSWORD}`

`Forgejo Actions` is enabled by default when creating a repository.

## Tests workflow

The `compose-demo-workflow.yml` compose file runs two demo workflows:
* one to verify the `Forgejo runner` can pick up a task from the Forgejo instance
and run it to completion.
* one to verify docker can be run inside the `Forgejo runner` container.

A new repository is created in root/test with the following workflows:

#### `.forgejo/workflows/demo.yml`:

```yaml
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: node-bookworm
    steps:
      - uses: https://code.forgejo.org/actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo All Good
```

#### `.forgejo/workflows/demo_docker.yml`

```yaml
on: [push]
jobs:
  test_docker:
    runs-on: docker-cli
    steps:
      - run: docker info
        shell: sh
```

A wait loop expects the status of the check associated with the
commit in Forgejo to show "success" to assert the workflow was run.

### Running

```sh
$ docker-compose -f compose-forgejo-and-runner.yml -f compose-demo-workflow.yml up demo-workflow
...
demo-workflow_1     | To http://forgejo:3000/root/test
demo-workflow_1     |  + 5ce134e...261cc79 main -> main (forced update)
demo-workflow_1     | branch 'main' set up to track 'http://root:admin1234@forgejo:3000/root/test/main'.
...
demo-workflow_1     | running
...
```
